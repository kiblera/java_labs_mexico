1) What is the difference between a byte stream and a character stream?
A byte stream is a convenient means for handling input and output of bytes like when reading or writing binary data.
A character stream handles and input and output of characters. They use UNicode and can be internationalized.

2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?
InputStream, OutputStream, PrintStream

3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?
Reader, Writer, BufferedReader

4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?
When the try block ends, the resource is automatically released. When using this, the second exception is suppressed but
not lost.

5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:
try (FileInputStream In = new FileInputStream(args[0])) {

    do  {
        i = fin.read();
        if(i != -1) System.out.print((char) i);
    } while(i != -1);

  }   catch(IOException exc)  {
    System.out.println("I/O Error: " + exc);
    }
  }
}

6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?
It displays the contents of a text file as a command-line argument.

7) What is the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)
java ShowFile TEST.TXT

8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?
Bytes

9) What is a BufferedReader?
A buffered input character stream; it is the best class for reading console input.

10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?
The InputStreamReader converts bytes to characters.

11) What does the InputStreamReader do with it's byte stream argument?
The object produced by InputStreamReader is used to construct a BufferedReader instance.

12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?
read() is a method to read characters from System.in in a similar was as they were read using byte streams.
readLine() is a method that reads strings from the keyboard and returns a String object.

13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt"
import java.io*;

class Yucatan {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s;

        try(BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("yucatan_cenotes.txt")))
        {
            while ((s - br.readline())  != null) {
                System.out.println(s);
            }
        } catch (IOException exc)  {
          System.out.println("I/O Error: " + exc);
        }
    }
}
