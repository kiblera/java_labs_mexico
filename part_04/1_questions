Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?  An array is a collection of variables of the same type, referred to by a common name.

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?
String[] cats = new String[10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?  An array of arrays.

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?
int [][] scores = new int[6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?
String dogName = dogs[9];

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?
  When you request an item that is outside the bounds of the array.
  For instance is you create an array with length 10 and then try to retrieve an item.
  from the 10th index creates IndexOutOfBounds error because final index is 9.

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.
int secondToLast = arrayName[arrayName.length - 2];

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java? 2147483647 or 2^31-1.

9) What is a bubble sort? A very inefficient sorting algorithm, requires a nested for loop.
Outer loop must run as many times as the length of the length of collection - 1.
Inner loop compares sequential pairs and swaps them if need be.
Depending on whether you're starting from the bottom or the top, the (next) smallest number will bubble to the top
on each subsequent loop (or vice versa, largest number bubble to the bottom on each loop)

10) How does a bubble sort work? It uses the repeated comparison so small values move toward one end and large ones
toward the other end. See above...

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?
The bus schedule, or number of riders

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.
for (int i = 0; i < array length; i++) {
    sout(array[i]);
    }

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.
int 1 = 0;
while(i < array.length){
    sout(array[i]);
    i++;
}

14) What is a queue? It is a list in which elements are accessed in first-in-first-out order.

15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs? Put and get

16) What is a stack? It is a list in which elements are accessed in first-in-last-out order.

17) What differentiates stacks and queues? FIFO vs FILO

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop? When you want to iterate over every item in a collection and you don't
need access to the index.

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?
Set of classes that implements various data structures in Java
It includes lists, vectors, sets and maps

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.
// assumes nums in a 2D array, ie nums[][]
for(int[] x : numx {
    for(int y : x){
        sout(y);
    }
}


for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
    for int j = 0; j < nums[i].length; j++){
        sout(nums[i]ij];
    }
}

21) What is a String?
A datatype composed of words
A string of chars
An object type is not a primitive type

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?
String str = "hey My Name Is";
int x = str.length();
str = str.replace("h", "HH")
str = str.SubString(0,6);

23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean? Once created, the character sequence that makes up the string cannot
be altered. Even if you're just adding one character to existing string, the old string is deleted and a new object is
created.

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
javac ClassName.java
java ClassName arg1 arg 2
